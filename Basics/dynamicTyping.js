// As like othere programming languages, js doesn't work like that.
//e.g.  int a = 12; but in js:  let a = 12; after that i can change the type of a, it can be string, bool etc.

let a = 12;
console.log(typeof a);
a = true;
console.log(typeof a);
a = 'Saurabh';
console.log(typeof a);
a = undefined;
console.log(typeof a);
a = null;
console.log(typeof a);

// this is called dynamic typing, js doesn't supports static typing.
